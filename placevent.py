Placevent

This program is designed to automatically place explicit solvent atoms/ions
based on 3D-RISM data. The 3D-RISM correlations should be in a DX file.

The details of the algorithm are described in: 

Placevent: An algorithm for prediction of explicit solvent atom distribution --
Application to HIV-1 protease and F-ATP synthase

This package requires Numpy.

g(r)_0 is printed in the occupation column
g(r)_i is printed in the beta column
